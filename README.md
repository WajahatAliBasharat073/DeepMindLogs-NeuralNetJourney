## Day 2: AI vs ML vs DL
- **AI:** AI is the broadest concept, referring to machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
  - **Goals:** To create systems that can think, reason, learn, and make decisions like humans.
  - **Examples:** Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT), Self-driving cars, Game-playing AI (e.g., AlphaGo), Robotics etc.
- **ML:** ML is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed..
  - **Goals:** To develop algorithms that can improve their performance on a task as they are exposed to more data.
  - **Types:** Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning.
  - **Examples:** Spam detection in emails, Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon),
Fraud detection in banking etc.
- **DL:** DL is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data.
  - **Goals:** To automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, enabling the system to perform tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
  - **Types:** Neural network, CNN, RNN, Transformers
  - **Examples:** Image classification (e.g., identifying cats vs. dogs),Speech-to-text systems (e.g., Siri, Alexa),Language translation (e.g., Google Translate) etc.

## Day 3: History & Types of Neural Networks 
```For Details go to Day3```
- **History:** Early Beginnings (1940s–1950s), The Perceptron (1950s–1960s), The AI Winter and Revival (1970s–1980s), The Rise of Deep Learning (1990s–2000s), Modern Era (2010s–Present)
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):** The simplest type of neural network, where data flows in one direction (input → hidden layers → output).
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Designed for processing grid-like data (e.g., images). Uses convolutional layers to detect spatial patterns like edges, shapes, and textures.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series, text). Uses loops to retain information from previous inputs.
- **LSTM:** A type of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and remember long-term dependencies.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):** A simplified version of LSTM with fewer parameters, making it faster to train.
- **Autoencoders:** Unsupervised neural networks used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consists of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—that compete to create realistic data.
- **Transformers:** A modern architecture that uses attention mechanisms to process sequential data more efficiently than RNNs.
- **Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN):** Uses radial basis functions as activation functions, often for interpolation and classification.
- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM):**  Unsupervised neural networks used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.
- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNN):** Mimics the behavior of biological neurons, using spikes to communicate.
